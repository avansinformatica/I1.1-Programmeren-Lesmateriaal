>>
>> **Notice:** You get the best button layout by changing the font and fontsize. In the screenshot, the font used by the buttons is set as follows:
>>
>>```java
>>Button button = new Button(" ");
>>button.setFont(Font.font("Monospaced", 40));
>>```
>>
>>#### Exercise gui-basics-7.1. User Interface
>>
>>Use the `BorderPane` component first to set up the user interface components. Place a text component at the top that contains information on turns and the end of the. Place a `GridPane` in the center, which contains 9 buttons. The `GridPane` must have 3 rows and 3 columns, making a 3x3 button grid.
>>
>>#### Exercise gui-basics-7.2. Changing routes and fair play
>>
>>The game is played by X and O. The game always starts with X. Add to the game the function where the button is pressed to update the situation by inserting the character of the player in turn (if X is the turn, X will be on the button). The turn then moves to the next player.
>>
>>The text field at the top of the game must always tell the player in turn. The text is initially "Turn X". When X plays its turn, i.e. presses a button, the text is set to "Turn: O". After O plays its turn, the text "Turn X" is set again.
>>
>>**Notice:** If a player has already played a particular location, no other player can play it anymore. Make sure the turn does not change when a player tries to play the already played screen.
>>
>>#### Exercise gui-basics-7.3: Completing the game
>>
>>Add game functionality to end a game. The game ends if one of the players gets three of the same characters in a line (vertical, horizontal, diagonal). The end of the game should display the text "End!" at the top. After this, the game will no longer be able to continue.
